# Tesla-Stock-Prediction-using-LSTM

Tesla Stock Prediction using LSTM
This project focuses on predicting the stock prices of Tesla using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that excels at analyzing and forecasting time series data.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical stock data for Tesla, including attributes such as the date, opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, and trading volume.
